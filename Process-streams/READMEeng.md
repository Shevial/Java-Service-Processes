followed by a formatted calendar that includes:
- The names of the months (e.g., "De gener", "De febrer", etc.).
- Days organized into columns corresponding to the days of the week.

**Utility:**  
- **Visualization:** Provides a quick view of the calendar in text format.
- **Redirection Practice:** Serves as an example of how to redirect a process’s output to a file.
- **Input for Processing:** Can be used as a data source for applications that need to analyze or transform text-based calendars (e.g., converting it to other formats such as CSV or JSON, or performing specific searches within the content).

## Conclusion

These examples demonstrate various techniques for managing process input and output in Java—from redirecting streams to files or the console, to manually creating pipelines between processes. Additionally, the generated `calendario.txt` file serves as a practical example of how a system command's output can be used to produce a resource that can be processed or visualized later.

This set of examples is fundamental for understanding the interaction between external processes and a Java application, providing a solid foundation for process integration and real-time data handling.
